Please take a look at the README.md of [SoundCheck repository](https://github.com/aniruddhas435/SoundCheck) before using the website.

Alternatively you can also copy content from some of the files with .raag extension from this folder, paste on the editor, click the **Run** button at the top right of the editor to see the performance on **Output** tab of the right window, by clicking on the pause button of the player, once the right window is populated with the required response. But I will still request you to go for the first option.

The styling of the audio player, that is there in the **Output** tab of the right window has been copied from [this repository](https://github.com/ankushChatterjee/simple-audio-player). The [contributor](https://github.com/ankushChatterjee) presents a walkthrough of the code in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/uPztDeHWhn8), feel free to take a look.
